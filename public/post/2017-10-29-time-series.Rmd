Welcome back! This time we are going to work on time series. A time series lets you put two sets of data to each other but one must be a variable of time.

Remember, load your packages.
```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

This time we will extract data about Babe Ruth's homeruns over his twenty-two seasons.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"

result<-sqldf(query)
```

Here we will make our time series visualization. Unlike the scatterplot, the data will be shown as lines, connecting to each point for easy reading throughout the years.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),size=1/2)+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle("Babe Ruth's Homeruns by Year")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Number of Homeruns")
```

There we go! Above is a great example of a time series!
