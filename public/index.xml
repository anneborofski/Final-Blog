      <description>Welcome back! This time we are going to work on time series. A time series lets you put two sets of data to each other but one must be a variable of time.
Remember, load your packages.

      <description>Our first lesson is on scatterplots! Here, we will take data on homeruns and strikeouts to make a scatterplot. The data will be extracted from the Lahman database of baseball statistics to make our product.
However, before we start, load the following packages below to make sure the computer knows which data to pull out.
library(Lahman)## Warning: package &amp;#39;Lahman&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.4.2library(sqldf)## Warning: package &amp;#39;sqldf&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.</description>
