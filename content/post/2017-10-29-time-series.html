<p>Welcome back! This time we are going to work on time series. A time series lets you put two sets of data to each other but one must be a variable of time.</p>
<p>Remember, load your packages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>This time we will extract data about Babe Ruthâ€™s homeruns over his twenty-two seasons.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE playerID=&#39;ruthba01&#39;&quot;

result&lt;-sqldf(query)</code></pre>
<p>Here we will make our time series visualization. Unlike the scatterplot, the data will be shown as lines, connecting to each point for easy reading throughout the years.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),size=1/2)+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle(&quot;Babe Ruth&#39;s Homeruns by Year&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Year&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Number of Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>There we go! Above is a great example of a time series!</p>
